    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At the end of 2023, I visited <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOFA)</a> in San Francisco. I encountered elementary school students who finished having a school field trip at SFMOMA when I just entered the museum, then I went to the second stair while imagining what the students saw and thought. The goal of my visit was to watch "Woman with a hat" by Henri Matisse, which is one of SFMOMA collection. I was excited to watch the paining that locates near various modern paintings SFMOMA has.</p>
<h2>Exhibition at Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum</h2>
<p>In the first place, the impetus to watch the painting went back to May 2023. I went to Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum to see <a href="https://www.tobikan.jp/en/exhibition/2023_matisse.html">the special exhibition featuring Matisse</a> while during the trip to Japan. I was totally intrigued by the exhibition due to two reasons. First reason is that there will be few opportunities to see Matisse's a lot of paintings at the same time during my life. In fact, there was about 150 paintings from Centre Pompidou at Paris. Second, I personally had been longing for seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxe,_Calme_et_Volupt%C3%A9">"Luxe, Calme et Volupté"</a> due to the audacious distribution of colors, and the painting came to the exhibition.</p>
<p><img alt="Title of the exhibition" src="/images/2_path_to_the_color.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a meaningful exhibition to see an overview of Matisse's life as an artist ranging from realistic paintings in his early stage to the chapel in his last days. Matisse is basically regarded as a key artist of Fauvism or a magician of colors, so a lot of people tend to focus on the usage of colors. However, I have felt that he would focus on not only colors but also shapes according to the exhibition. For example, let's take a look at "The Back Ⅰ-Ⅳ" that represents back of a woman. There was a trajectory of an abstraction from the woman's back with clear lines to one with only vertical lines, implying that he would explore a rebellion of the shape. Based on my perspective, Matisse might have kept himself asking, "what is the minimum composition of the object in terms of colors and shapes?", and the goal would lead to keeping an eye on cutout pictures and chapels because the compositions of them are very simple (Of course, the interest in cutout pictures was mainly related to his physical challenges). As a machine learning researcher, my research theme is representation learning, and I am really interested in the minimum composition of objects. The closeness between my interest and his interest made me a little glad.</p>
<p>Anyway, there seemed to be few paintings in the days of Fauvism at the exhibition. I understand that Fauvism does not represent all of himself and that the days were only one portion of his long life as an artist. Hence, this observation was just based on my preference. I have not investigated where to see his famous paintings of the Fauvism days, "Woman with a hat" and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Stripe">"Portrait of Madame Matisse (The green line)"</a> and found that the latter is in Statens Museum for Kunst and that the former is in SFMOMA. That is why I have decided to go to SFMOMA to watch the painting, and I am here.</p>
<h2>Woman with a hat</h2>
<p><img alt="Woman with a hat" src="/images/1_woman_with_a_hat.jpg"></p>
<p>"Woman with a hat" represents a rebellion of colors. Almost all the colors here would be detached from the real colors in front of him. Even the color of the dress is totally different because his wife wore the black dress at that time according to the caption. Although I do not touch where was an origin of Fauvism in the detail because various medias have mentioned about that, seeing "Luxe, Calme et Volupté" has strengthened the idea that Pointillism would have given a hint to Fauvism. Pointillism artists put dots with complementary colors (unrealistic colors) to make the painting more vivid. Although Surat, who is the founder of Pointillism, had put millions of tiny dots following the principle, Signac or Delaunay gradually had enlarged the size of dots, and the a ratio of unrealistic colors occupied in the painting became greater. The transition would give various artists the idea, "Are there any necessities to put colors that the real object has?", leading to Fauvism. Therefore, based on the transition and the expansion of Pointillism to various artists (Delaunay, Van Gogh, and Kandinsky), not only Matisse had the possibility to start Fauvism, and many artists might have possibilities to invent Fauvism-like paintings. However, he was the only person to achieve the delicate construction of the audacious colors and beautiful appearance. Hence, "Woman with a hat" is a monumental work as the advent of Fauvism.</p>
