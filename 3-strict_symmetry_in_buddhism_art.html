    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I visited <a href="https://asianart.org/">Asian Art Museum</a> in San Francisco on November 2, 2024. My primary reason for going was to explore how Asian art, especially Japanese art, is perceived in US as a Japanese person. In addition to that, I wanted to view Chinese paintings, as I had recently developed an interest in Chinese art. My visit was fulfilling. Comprehensive explanations of the arts seem to captivate visitors. Also, I was totally inspired by the magnificent Chinese paintings, which offered profound insights from both local and global perspective. However, the article is not about those aspects; It is about one Buddhist sculpture that captivated my attention to pause and reflect. </p>
<h3>Scenes of the Life of Buddha</h3>
<p>The stone sculpture, titled <a href="https://searchcollection.asianart.org/objects/12303/scenes-of-the-life-of-the-buddha">"Scenes of the Life of Buddha"</a>, was discovered in India and dates back to between 1000 and 1200 CE. As the title indicates, various scenes from the life of Buddha are intricately curved into the stone. Despite its astonishingly small size (16.5 cm x W. 12.7 cm x D. 5.1 cm), each scene is crafted with extraordinary precision. Examining the sculpture reveals three horizontal lines with a relatively larger central Buddha representing his victory over Mara. Each row has four representations of Buddha, and rightmost and leftmost ones mean memorable scenes. According to the <a href="https://about.asianart.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/SA02_placard-masterpiece-sm.pdf">museum document</a>, each scene can be summarized in the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Order of line from above</th>
<th>Leftmost scene</th>
<th>Rightmost scene</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1st</td>
<td>The Buddha's descent from Indra's Heaven</td>
<td>The Buddha taming an enraged elephant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2nd</td>
<td>The Buddha's preaching</td>
<td>No descriptions. It may be different scene from the leftmost scene because the pedestal is different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3rd</td>
<td>The Buddha accepting an offering from a monkey</td>
<td>The Buddha's birth</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Every scene has to be distinct. Nevertheless, scenes within the same line are so similar that they can be difficult to differentiate. The scenes in the 3rd row are relatively easier to distinguish due to their pronounced poses. In contrast, the scenes in the 2nd line appear nearly identical, though the meaning of the rightmost scene remains unclear. Similarly, the scenes in the 1st line also resemble each other, though some parts are damaged. 
Turning to another sculpture, titled <a href="https://searchcollection.asianart.org/objects/11146/seated-crowned-buddha-with-four-scenes-of-his-life">"Seated crowned Buddha with four scenes of his life"</a>, which was also found in India and dates back to 1100 and 1200 CE, there are two rows framing the central Buddha. The upper line depicts two scenes: the Buddha's descent from Indra's Heaven and the Buddha taming an enraged elephant. They are so similar that they are nearly indistinguishable unless one notices the small elephant in the latter. Additionally, I spotted another sculpture with identical poses, differing only in the design of the pedestal. The strict symmetry, which seems to prioritize aesthetic balance over narrative clarity, struck me as peculiar. Of course, the emphasis on symmetry various depending on the region or era where the sculptures are created. However, the overall impression of viewing the collection of Buddhist art from India symmetry seems to have been a significant focus.</p>
<h3>Scenes of the Life of Christ</h3>
<p>When it comes to the sculpture depicting scenes of life of a significant figure, many examples portray the life of Christ. One such piece is the <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/31438/diptych-leaf-with-scenes-from-the-passion-of-christ/">"Diptych Leaf with Scenes from the Passion of Christ"</a>made of ivory found in France dating back to 1250-1270. Despite its small size (32.6 x 13 x 0.8 cm), it also captures scenes ranging from Temptation of Judas to Entombment, with each scene clearly distinguishable. Another example is the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/468339">"Diptych with Scenes from the Passion of Jesus"</a> found in France dating back to 1350s. The piece features six scenes that are distinct enough to be easily recognized. While the arches framing each scene maintain symmetric, the entire symmetry is less rigid compared to that of Buddhist sculptures. </p>
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>So is strict symmetry or loose symmetry a key characteristic in defining the direction of India Buddhism art or Christian art? Answering the question is challenging and requires comprehensive investigation of these arts across various regions and time periods. The following is my "rough" hypothesis to start my exploration. I guess that the strict symmetry serves as the strong condition in the creation of arts. When the symmetry becomes highly pronounced, it often diminishes the realistic detail, transforming the artwork into a symbol or icon. The Buddhist sculptures discussed above likely are not the educational contents but the spiritual icons for the followers. Conversely, the asymmetry leads to more realistic and detailed depictions, enhancing the ability to convey specific narratives. The characteristic is evident in Christian art, where paintings and sculptures would be visual foundations to illustrate the stories of the New Testament. The contrast between symmetry and asymmetry would represent the most fundamental differences when comparing the artistic traditions of Buddhism and Christianity. </p>
